Contribution Breakdown For Lab 7

Our Approach:

We all decided to meet up outside of class and worked on the lab together. During these meetings, 
we split up the work by the requirements. So, one person would work on FR1, while another person 
would work on FR2, etc. One of us also took on the task of figuring out the setup and the connection 
to the database, which was mostly smooth for Mac Users whereas Windows (1 person) took some more time 
to set up. While working together, we made sure to follow the non-functional requirements such as protecting
against malicious input and helped each out parallel programming style. Once we had laid a foundation 
for each of the requirements, we all tackled debugging together as it was a much longer process.

Breakdown:

Sahil - Setup (Connection, Files, etc), FR4
Sreshta - User Interface, FR1, FR5
Rajvir - FR2, FR3
